def join_bldgs_blocks(buildings, blocks, building_id_key="sf16_BldgID"):
    """
    Performs a geo-spatial join on buildings and blocks. Each of the `buildings` searches for `blocks` that it
    intersects with. In a good case, the building is found to be located within a particular block. In a bad case, the
    building is found to match with no blocks (if the space it is located on seemingly isn't included in `blocks`) or
    with many blocks (if its footprint intersects with more than one block).

    This function therefore returns a tuple of three items: `matches` for buildings uniquely joined to blocks,
    `multimatches` for buildings joined to multiple blocks, a `nonmatches` for buildings joined to no blocks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buildings: gpd.GeoDataFrame
        A tabular `GeoDataFrame` whose `geometry` consists of building footprints in the area of interest.

    blocks: gpd.GeoDataFrame
        A tabular `GeoDataFrame` whose `geometry` corresponds with all block footprints in the area of interest.

    building_id_key: str, default "sf16_BldgID"
        A unique ID for the buildings. This field must be present in the `buildings` dataset, and it must be uniquely
        keyed.

    Returns
    -------
    (matches, multimatches, nonmatches) : tuple
        A tuple of three `GeoDataFrame`. The first element is of buildings-block pairs that are unique, the second
        element is buildings that span multiple blocks, and the third is buildings that span no blocks (at least
        according to the data given).
